* About Prep
** Practice implementing on paper -> then computer
** implement every single DS and algorithm on [[file:prep.org]]
* Other
** interviews are SUPPOSED to be difficult
** During interview
*** listen carefully
- ask questions
- write down pertinent information
*** draw example
- specific example - not general
- sufficiently large
- not special case
*** state brute force
- should not let interviewer think you are struggling to see even the easy solution
- explain space and time complexity
- starting point for optimization
- helps wrap head around problem
*** Optimize
- look for unused information
- fresh example
- time vs space tradeoff
- precompute information
- hash table
*** walkthrough
- solidify understanding before writing
- make sure code is as close to perfect in the beginning as possible
-
*** Implement
- write beautiful code
  + modularized
  + error checks
  + good variable names
*** Test
- usually: take earlier example and test -> might discover bugs but is slow
- conceptual test -> read and analyze each line
- hot spots -> base cases in recursive code, integer division, null nodes in binary trees
- small test cases
- special cases
