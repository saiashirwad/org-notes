* Strongly Connected Components
** Kosaraju's Algorithm
[[file:~/prep/graphs/scc.cpp][Code C++]]
[[file:./images/screenshot-01.png]]
*** Description
- find all strongly connected components in O(V+E)
- DFS two times
  + DFS of graph produces single tree if all vertices reachable from starting point
  + else: forest
- may find tree or forest depending on where start
  + 0, 1, 2 -> tree
  + 3, 4 -> forest
- *finish time of a vertex that connects to other SCCs will always be greater than finish times of vertices in the other SCC*

*** Datastructures:
- stack s
*** Method
**** DFS traversal of graph
- create empty stack S
- recursive DFS traversal for adjacent vertices of vertex -> push vertex to stack
- starting from 0: 1, 2, 4, 3, 0
**** Reverse directions of all arcs -> transpose graph
**** DFS on transpose graph
- while S is not empty
  + pop vertex v from S
  + take v as source -> DFSUtil()
  + DFS from v -> strongly connected components of v
